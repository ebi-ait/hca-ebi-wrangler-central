# Tasks

<!-- 
Begin with a introductory tasks and introduction. This could be something like:
-->
Welcome to the HCA DCP! We are pleased to introduce you to the data wrangling team. Before beginning to work by yourself, you'll be asked to complete a set of tasks and meetings. These will guide you through both the general and specifics of your role, and it will help us make sure you understand how we work in the team. Your introductory tasks are:

- [ ] Read the Onboarding doc.
- [ ] Convert this issue into an epic.
- [ ] Create an issue for each task and link it to this epic.
- [ ] Clone all the basic repos to your computer (look at the introductory document (On hold) for more information)
- [ ] Locate all the metadata schemas and documents regarding SOPs. 

<!--For the wrangler: Feel free to add more tasks if necessary.-->


## General tasks

<!-- Now, the general wrangling tasks should go here. The tasks suggested below can be considered  as the most general and "applicable" to all new wranglers -->

These are more wrangling-specific tasks. They will provide you with the basic knowledge necessary to perform your future tasks in the team. These include:
1. Review the DCP-wide [onboarding material](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/wiki/wiki/Engineering-Onboarding).
1. Watch HCA Metadata Standard 101 [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12hGA3_ARTKl-W0JxMKm8fHqvx31L3Ohf) ([slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CJZfFpVFPolYPf30NSNn3A4CPVHmbfbaHUKlzCqBz_c)).
1. Familiarise yourself with the projects and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) inside the hca-wrangling repo.
1. Familiarise yourself with the graph structure and the model that is being used.
1. Get familiarised with the [spreadsheet generator](https://github.com/HumanCellAtlas/schema-template-generator).
1. Read up on FAIR Data Principles
    - [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship (Wilkinson 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
    - [A design framework and exemplar metrics for FAIRness (Wilkinson 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018118)
    - [Quick summary](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) of FAIR Data Principles
    - Also related: [Uniform resolution of compact identifiers for biomedical data (Wimalaratne 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201829)
1. Add or update tickets in wrangling or metadata-schema repo to reflect work being done.
<These tasks are in the order they are meant to be introduced to the wrangler.>

<!--1. Additional tasks, if necessary-->

## Specific role tasks

These tasks will give you an insight on your role, and provide you with the appropriate tools to proceed in your job.
<!-- 
A list of more specific wrangling issues here. This should be unique to the position the wrangler is going to specifically fill (e.g., review the projects from the MRC grant)

Can be deleted if there are no specific role tasks.

# Onboard Meetings

These meetings will help you understand some aspects of the work here, as well as our work policy and important details about what technologies we use. They will be short (around 30 minutes) and you should try to get at least one per day. You will be expected to book the meeting with the person that is supposed to give it.

<!-- Onboard meetings should be listed here. A suggestion on the order and the meetings is below. -->
1. Introduction to agile: The manifesto and basic concepts. Project Manager (PM), Product Owner (PO), sprint, standup, tickets and story points.
1. Computational environments: DCP's Github workflow, recommended software (PyCharm, sublime, google sync, notes, postman).
1. Developmental environments: General release cycles and release coordination.
1. Metadata repository 1: Entities structure: core, type and module. Graphs as a tool to represent a project.
1. Metadata repository 2: Introduction to JSON, schema evolution and versioning.
1. Technologies: 10x, SMART-Seq2, Imaging transcriptomics, CITE-Seq, ATAC-Seq <,whatever technology we have implemented.>
1. Wrangling repository: Tools, vignettes, tickets, MarkDown documents and processes.
1. Spreadsheet generator: The spreadsheets and the contributor form. General tour and how to generate one.
1. Linked knowledge: Quick introduction to ontologies.
1. Boxes: DCP and organization.
1. Ingest box: Overview of ingest infrastructure.

<!--
But it is as flexible as the wrangling team wants. Maybe not all the meetings can be done, depends on the actual people in the team. 
Try to specify the timing (about 30 minutes), the pacing, and who should give the "lecture", but encourage the new wrangler to book the meetings by themselves.
Since the wranglers will change over time, the wrangler that creates this issue is supposed to include the people that will give each lecture.

# Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Finish all the tasks outlined.
- [ ] Close this issue.
