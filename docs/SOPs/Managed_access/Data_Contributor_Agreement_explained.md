# Data Contributor Agreement explained
The Data Contributor Agreement (DCA) is a legal agreement between the data contributor and HCA Inc, where the contributor authorises HCA to publish their data on the Data Portal with appropriate reuse conditions. 

The reuse conditions are:
- NRES: Non-Restricted Use - for Open access
- GRU: General Research Use - for Managed access
- GRU-NCU: General Research Use, Non-Commercial use - for Managed access, non-commercial use only

To start signing the DCA through [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/en-gb#drd) the contributors need to provide:
- The name and email address of the institutional representative who will sign the DCA on behalf of the data contributor organisation. This person must be authorised to sign legal agreements for their institution.
- The name and email address of the person who will sign the DCA as Principal Investigator. This person is required to ensure all data accepted into the HCA has the requisite protection measures, therefore adhering to local data protection laws and regulations.

HCA data wranglers are the first party to fill in the DCA and are responsible for providing a project uuid.

At the moment the DocuSign process is owned by the HCA executive office, but we are in the process of setting up a wrangler account for DocuSign so that a designated HCA data wrangler can start the signing process.
