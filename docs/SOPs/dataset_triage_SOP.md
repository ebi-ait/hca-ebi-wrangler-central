# Dataset Triage SOP

### Dataset Prioritisation

1. **Directly contributed data** 
  - From co-funded collaborators (e.g. WSSS or MRC or HCA:Organoid, Seed Networks), then
  - First come first serve
 
 
2. **Data from official Human Cell Atlas publications**
  - Newest first, oldest last
  - Published Data on primary tissues
  - Poorly represented donor sample locations first (i.e. US, European donors will be actively down-prioritised). Once data from all possible locations is captured, then
  - Organs with least coverage first, organs with most coverage last
 
 
3. **All other eligible Published Data**, 

 scored by a combination of:

  - Organ coverage in the HCA, and
  - Cell count size, and
  - Commonality of technology

### Note
Lists of ranked donor locations and ranked sample locations need to be completed.

### Prioritisation Discussion Meetings

A regular meeting will be set up for the designed ops lead to discuss and prioritise with the product owner and the project manager the elegible datasets.
