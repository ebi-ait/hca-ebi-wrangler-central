## Steps

### Step 1: Submit for Archiving

1. Once the data files are uploaded and the submission has been validated, the submission should be listed as **Graph Valid.**
2. On the _Submit_ tab, click the Submit Button.
3. The submission will be marked as **Processing** as it maps the experimental graph
4. Once finished, the submission will be marked as: **Archiving**
    1. **Please now poke your #hca-operations buddies to continue the process below by Archiving the Metadata to DSP.**
    
### Step 2 - Submit project, study, samples and sequencing experiments using the Archiver and DSP service

#### Before using the Archiver service 

Please note when using the documentation below:

*   There is a difference between **api**.ingest… and **archiver**.ingest…
    * API -> **ingest_submission_uuid**
    * Archiver -> **dsp_submission_uuid**
*   Obtain and replace `{archiver_api_key}` with the key obtained by running the following cmd (replace `dev` with `staging` or `prod` depending on the environment):
    *   specify if prod/staging/dev
        ```bash
         aws --region us-east-1 secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id ingest/archiver/wrangler/secrets --query SecretString --output text | jq -jr .prod_archiver_api_key
        ``` 
    *   If you can't retrieve the archiver service api key using this command, it is likely because you do not have the required permissions. Ask a dev or wrangler to obtain the key


#### Archiver endpoints
There are currently 3 environments that you can use for the archiver:

1. `https://archiver.ingest.dev.archive.data.humancellatlas.org`: Corresponding to **DSP test environment**
1. `https://archiver.ingest.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org`: Corresponding to **DSP test environment**
1. `https://archiver.ingest.archive.data.humancellatlas.org`: Corresponding to **DSP production environment**

Please make sure you are using the proper endpoint when archiving (Instruction and examples written for the staging environment)

#### Using the Archiver service

Once a submission is ready in ingest (`Archiving` status after hitting submit), you need to follow the next steps:

1. Open a terminal
1. Create a DSP submission given an ingest submission UUID with a POST request
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://archiver.ingest.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/archiveSubmissions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Api-Key: {archiver_api_key}' -d '{"submission_uuid": "{ingest_submission_uuid}", "alias_prefix": "HCA", "exclude_types": ["sequencingRun"] }'
   ```
   Please note this is an async request and even if it's successfully triggered (You will get a response saying that), it may take a while to create the submission.

1. Retrieve the DSP submission UUID via the ingest submission UUID

   ```bash
   curl -X GET  -H 'Api-Key: {archiver_api_key}' https://archiver.ingest.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/latestArchiveSubmission/<ingest_submission_uuid>
   ```

   TThis request should give you the **latest archive submission entity** in Ingest. The entity contains the DSP submission UUID in the json response, it also gives the full DSP submission url.

1. Check if submission is submittable

    Check validation errors
    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://archiver.ingest.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/archiveSubmissions/<dsp_submission_uuid>/validationErrors -H 'Api-Key: {archiver_api_key}' 
    ```

    Check any submission blockers
    ```bash
    curl -X GET https://archiver.ingest.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/archiveSubmissions/<dsp_submission_uuid>/blockers -H 'Api-Key: {archiver_api_key}' 
    ```

    Ignore the following if there are no validation errors nor submission blockers.
    
    If there are **validation errors**, we may have to fix something in the archiver's conversion, in which case we need to delete the archive submission entities in Ingest and DSP submission and start from [Step 1: Submit for Archiving](#step-1-submit-for-archiving)) again.  
   
    Get AAP token needed to delete DSP submission:
    ```bash
    curl -u hca-ingest:<aap-password> https://api.aai.ebi.ac.uk/auth > aap.jwt
    export AAP_TOKEN=`cat aap.jwt`
    ```
    The `hca-ingest` is the AAP username of the Archiver service and the password should be in the AWS secrets [ingest/prod/secrets](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home?region=us-east-1#!/secret?name=ingest%2Fprod%2Fsecrets) , see the value for `aap_api_password`. Only an Ingest developer has an access to this.

    Delete the DSP submission:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $AAP_TOKEN" <dsp-url>
    ```

    Please also delete the **archive submission entity** created to track this DSP submission in Ingest. For this request, you need to use the Ingest API token which you can get from the Ingest UI.
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $INGEST_API_TOKEN" <ingest-archive-submission-self-url>
    ```

    If there are **validation errors/blockers** and we couldn't resolve ourselves, pls contact karoly@ebi.ac.uk or mhaseeb@ebi.ac.uk in the [#data-submission-portal](https://embl-ebi-ait.slack.com/archives/CNL3AH7BQ) slack channel 

1. Once the archive metadata entities are validated, to finish the submission, just run the following request to complete the submission:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://archiver.ingest.staging.archive.data.humancellatlas.org/archiveSubmissions/<dsp_submission_uuid>/complete -H 'Api-Key: {archiver_api_key}' 
    ```

### Step 3 - Submit sequencing runs directly to ENA

Follow Step 3 (Submit new sequencing runs) of [Update ENA runs SOP](update_ena_runs_SOP.md#3---submit-new-sequencing-runs) page.
