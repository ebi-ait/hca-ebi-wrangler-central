In some cases it might be important to access Terra Data Repository staging area via command line.

Such cases could include:
- investigate validation errors from Import team
- clear up staging area for a clean (re-)export

Dev team has an [SOP](https://ebi-ait.github.io/hca-ebi-dev-team/admin_setup/Setting-up-access-to-Terra-staging-area.html) to set up an account and access.
