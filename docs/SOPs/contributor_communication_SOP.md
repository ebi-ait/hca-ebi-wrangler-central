# Contributor communication SOP
{: .no_toc }

## Background
{: .no_toc }

While wrangling a dataset from a contributor a wrangler needs to be in contact with the contributor in order to get the required metadata and data for a submission. This document provides guidance on how communication with contributors should be approached.

## General guidelines

<i class="fa fa-reply-all" aria-hidden="true"></i> **CC the wrangler-team email** in all communications with contributors so that the team is aware of the current status and can pick up on communications if the primary wrangler is unavailable.

<i class="fa fa-comments-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-github-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Record key communication events** in the related github project tracker ticket by ticking the relevant box or making a comment if more detail is useful. 

<i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Keep emails **clear**, **concise** and to the point 

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ensure the **most important information is first** - expect that the reader could lose interest at any moment

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Make the subject line **capture attention**, including HCA/Human Cell Atlas is useful

<i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Be **gracious, polite and friendly** 

<i class="fa fa-phone-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> Always leave the option of a **meeting to chat** if things seem to be getting complicated

## First contact
The aim of the first contact with a contributor is to find out some key information about the project and ask the contributor to provide more detailed information using the data questionnaire form(https://forms.gle/KFYna7zGdQvwya8b8) or by setting up a meeting in-person or via video chat.

The first contact email should contain:
- Link to register as part of the HCA
- Link to the dataset questionnaire(https://forms.gle/KFYna7zGdQvwya8b8) or an attempt to set up a meeting

[Template email](#first-contact---data-questionnaire){: .btn .btn-blue }

## Follow-up contact
Once the primary wrangler has gained more information about the dataset, a custom spreadsheet can be generated with the relevant tabs and fields for the contributor’s experiment. 

Before any data and metadata can be received, either the contributor or an authorised representative from their lab, must agree to the HCA terms and conditions by completing the HCA terms and conditions form.

The first follow up email should contain:
- Link to terms and conditions form (https://forms.gle/8XW8vapGQJRfKrc36)

[Template email](#terms-and-conditions-and-consent){: .btn .btn-blue }

Once the terms and conditions form is complete, the metadata spreadsheet and the instructions and credentials for uploading data to their ingest upload area can be provided to the contributor. 

The second follow-up email should contain:
- Custom metadata spreadsheet
- Link to metadata spreadsheet guide
- Upload area uuid that is unique to the contributor
- AWS contributor credentials
- Link to instructions for how to upload data to an upload area(https://github.com/ebi-ait/hca-documentation/wiki/How-to-upload-data-to-an-upload-area-using-hca-util)

[Template email](#spreadsheet-and-data-upload-instructions){: .btn .btn-blue }

### Frequency of contact

After sending an email, we generally think one week is a reasonable time to respond. If a primary wrangler has not received any response or reason for delay they should send a reminder email after a week.

The reminder email should prompt the contributor to complete the step required to enable the wrangler to continue with their submission. It is nice to offer a call to talk over where the contributor may have been stuck.

If there is no response after a further week, the primary wrangler should send another prompting email.

If after two reminder emails have been sent without a response, the wrangler could consider: 
- CC’ing the PI or project manager of the contributor’s project
- Bringing it to the attention of the Ingest Product Owner/Manager and asking for advice
- For CZI funded projects - Jonah?

## Confirming details, filling gaps
It is normal for some details to be missed by the contributor in the first instance. 

There are some fields that aren’t strictly required but a wrangler should chase if possible:

For CBTM & HDBR donors
 - We have other means of accessing the full set of releasable metadata from these tissue banks so it is a good idea to check our sources to ensure we can include as much information as possible

For developmental donors
- For embryos we ideally want carnegie stage, all HDBR samples should have this
- Post-Conception weeks is a mandatory chase. Based on the survey we sent recently that was the most wanted field by the community.
- genotype/karyotype information

For all experiments
- Ethnicity
- Age
- Estimated number of cells
- **Library preparations**: If more than 1 set of fastq files per library preparation, make sure the approach is properly displayed.
Same library preparation was sequenced several times/produces more than 1 set of fastq files: Fill in the lane_index and communicate with contributors.
Different library preparations come from one cell suspension: Make sure the library preps are separated properly with the proper process.process_core.process_id

It is also common for a wrangler to need to confirm ontology curations. It is possible that a new ontology term will need to be created if an appropriate term doesn’t exist

Only if there are supplementary files: Make sure the files have been input twice in the spreadsheet (In the proper tab and in the `Supplementary files` tab). Once the files are uploaded make sure that they are called exactly the same.

## Final confirmation before submission

Once a submission is 100% valid and has been reviewed, a final confirmation email should be sent to the contributor with the latest spreadsheet attached to confirm they are happy with the curation.

[Template email](#final-confirmation-before-submission){: .btn .btn-blue }

## Confirmation of Accessions

Once the submission has been successfully archived, accessions should be communicated back to the contributor. If there is a risk that the deadline the contributor gave will not be met, the contributor should be contacted to inform them of the risk and offer alternatives or work arounds. The project level accessions should be provided within the main body of the email.

Once the dataset is released in an HCA snapshot release, the contributor should be informed and provided with the link to their dataset on the HCA Data Browser.

## Managed/controlled access data

When talking to contributors about managed/controlled access data there are some important issues to note.

## Template emails
These templates are considered a guide to provide a skeleton with the required information. The primary wrangler can choose to edit and customise to make it more personal or appropriate for the situation.

### First contact - Data questionnaire

> Dear [name/s of contributor/s],
> 
> Thank you for contacting us regarding your interest in registering your project with the Human Cell Atlas! Below you will find the first steps:
> 
> 1 Register as part of the HCA by filling the following form: https://www.humancellatlas.org/register (if you haven’t already)
> 
> 2 Please fill out the dataset questionnaire (https://forms.gle/HWADhk3Z6hUEbvVh8). The questionnaire  asks for information about your experiments. This will help us create a tailor spreadsheet for you to fill out about your project
